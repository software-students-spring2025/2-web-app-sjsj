## Steps necessary to run the software

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, open the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run:
$ git clone <https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/2-web-app-sjsj> $
$ cd <2-web-app-sjsj>$

## Step 2: Install pipenv (On your actual terminal)
It is recommended to set a virtual environment with pipenv, which can be installed with the command:
$ pip install pipenv $
$ pipenv shell $

## Step 3: Set up the Project Environment 
Navigate to your project directory (if not already there) and run:
$ pipenv shell $
$ pipenv install flask $
$ pipenv install pymongo $

## Step 4: Run the application
$ python app.py $
This will output the local address where your Flask web application is running. The link can be copied and pasted to a web browser or those on Visual Studio Code can press the command key and click on the link.
